# seq

A sequence library for Go.

This is mainly an attempt to bring map, reduce & filter to the language in an idiomatic way.

(despite Rob Pike writing a similar library but falling back to for loops)

## Notes

Based on Clojure's concept of Seq that lists/vectors/maps work from.

Ideally we should be able to chain map/reduce/filter functions together.
